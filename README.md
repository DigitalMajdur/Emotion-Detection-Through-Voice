# Emotion-Detection-Through-Voice
Real-Time Audio Emotion Recognition
This project focuses on real-time and static audio emotion recognition using machine learning models. The goal is to accurately classify emotions such as happy, sad, angry, and neutral from audio data.

Key Features:

1) Real-time audio processing: Captures voice data through a microphone and performs real-time emotion prediction.

2) Static audio testing: Allows testing with pre-recorded audio files for better evaluation of model performance.

3) Multiple emotion classes: Supports classification of a range of common emotions.

4) High accuracy: Achieves 93-95% accuracy in controlled environments.

Goal:

To develop a robust emotion detection system that can process both real-time and static audio data efficiently. This project serves as a foundation for further improvements and potential real-world applications in areas like virtual assistants, customer support, and mental health monitoring.
