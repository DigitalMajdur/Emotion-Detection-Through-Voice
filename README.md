# Emotion-Detection-Through-Voice
Real-Time Audio Emotion Recognition
This project focuses on real-time and static audio emotion recognition using machine learning models. The goal is to accurately classify emotions such as happy, sad, angry, and neutral from audio data.

Key Features:

1) Real-time audio processing: Captures voice data through a microphone and performs real-time emotion prediction.

2) Static audio testing: Allows testing with pre-recorded audio files for better model performance evaluation.

3) Multiple emotion classes: Supports classification of common emotions.

4) High accuracy: Achieves 93-95% accuracy in controlled environments.

Goal:

To develop a robust emotion detection system that can efficiently process both real-time and static audio data. This project serves as a foundation for further improvements and potential real-world applications in areas like virtual assistants, customer support, and mental health monitoring.


Before doing anything else use this code line in your terminal 

pip install numpy pandas tensorflow matplotlib seaborn librosa tqdm pickle scikit-learn sounddevice

For jupyternotebook remember to use " ! " before pip to run into a syntax error

For Vscode paste the above line of code in the terminal section refer to the bottom image for that
